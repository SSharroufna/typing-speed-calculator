# Typing Speed Calculator Game
## Milestone 1: Description of Project
The Typing Speed Game is an interactive app to help players improve their typing skills. The game will start by dropping random words from the top of the screen that players must type as quickly and accurately as possible before it reaches the bottom. 

The player will have 3 attempts, after which it will show that the game calculates and displays their typing speed, words per minute (WPM), along with accuracy stats. 
### Intended audience
The intended audience ranges from those who are looking to improve typing speed and accuracy, students learning keyboard skills, to casual gamers. 
### Inspiration
We are inspired by the other existing typing game platforms that enhance and gamify learning important keyboard skills.
