# Typing Speed Calculator Game
## Milestone 1: Description of Project
The Typing Speed Game is an interactive app to help players improve their typing skills. The game will start by dropping random words from the top of the screen that players must type as quickly and accurately as possible before it reaches the bottom. 

The player will have 3 attempts, after which it will show that the game calculates and displays their typing speed, words per minute (WPM), along with accuracy stats. 
### Intended audience
The intended audience ranges from those who are looking to improve typing speed and accuracy, students learning keyboard skills, to casual gamers. 
### Inspiration
We are inspired by the other existing typing game platforms that enhance and gamify learning important keyboard skills.

Our first step was to focus on user interactions, checking the input against the current word from our word array. We implemented state changes for the number of lives remaining and score, and used the useEffect hook to track the elapsed time. Currently, the user loses a life if the letter they type doesnâ€™t match the current letter in the word. The user can use backspace to fix their mistake, this does not effect their remaining lives. When all lives are lost, the screen displays "Game Over," along with their final score, elapsed time, and a button to restart the game. We also added logic to reset the game, restoring all states to their initial values.

Next, we plan to calculate accuracy and speed. After that, we'll explore animations featuring multiple randomly generated words moving across the screen. In this setup, the user will lose a life if the word disappears off the screen. If this proves unfeasible, we'll shift focus to styling the game with a theme, potentially ocean-themed. Or, focus on creating multiple difficulties, for example, longer word lengths or uncommon words.
